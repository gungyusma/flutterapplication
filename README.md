# Flutter Travel UI Starter

This app was created following the [Youtube video of Marcus Ng](https://youtu.be/CSa6Ocyog4U)

After following some Flutter and Dart tutorials, building this application was a step forward as the complexity of the UI we are building and the number of details is higher than in the previous ones. 

It was a good way to learn more about creating beatiful material design applications with Flutter and I will use this knowledge in future apps.
